# Open Avatar Standards (OAS)


## Purpose

The Open Avatar Standards Working Group exists to advance interoperable, intelligent, and expressive avatars for the open metaverse, aligning avatar platforms, engines, and AI agents around shared protocols, open tooling, and decentralized infrastructure.

We aim to foster a vibrant ecosystem of composable, open-source infrastructure and best practices that enable diverse avatar formats, agents, reputation, and engines to interoperate seamlessly.


## Vision & Values

We believe digital avatars, agents, and identities should be truly owned and controlled by their users, not confined to proprietary ecosystems or restricted by platform silos.

Users, creators, and intelligent agents must have the freedom to choose where and how their avatars appear, evolve, and interact, across platforms and experiences.

This includes the ability to:

- Carry identity and assets across virtual worlds  
- Modify or extend avatars without platform lock-in  
- Embed ownership, attribution, and rights metadata directly into avatar formats, including IP rights and usage restrictions  
- Enable permissioned interoperability through open, transparent standards  

Blockchain technologies, decentralized identifiers, and on-chain ownership systems are powerful enablers of this vision, providing persistence, portability, composability, and verifiability across experiences.

Our work is grounded in the values of the open metaverse and is committed to the principles of **decentralization**, **interoperability**, **user agency**, and **open creativity**.

We also seek long-term alignment and collaboration with the **[Metaverse Standards Forum](https://metaverse-standards.org/)** to ensure compatibility and mutual advancement of shared goals in avatar and identity interoperability.

## Scope

We focus on the intersection of **3D avatars**, **intelligent agents**, and **runtime modularity**, supporting both visual fidelity and behavioral depth. This includes tooling for:

- Modular avatar construction (rigs, meshes, materials, physics, optimizations)  
- Agentic personality and behavior binding (via MCP, Model Context Protocol and other tools)  
- Real-time transformation between avatar systems (UBF, MML, Unreal, Unity, Web/ThreeJS)  
- Cross-engine interpreters and previews  
- Token-enabled identity and ownership standards  

This work supports the broader mission of building an open metaverse, where identity, agency, and creativity are fluid, portable, and user-owned.

## R&D Methodology

The Working Group operates as a **collaborative R&D lab**, focused on rapid prototyping, research, and open-source implementation. We emphasize **proof before standardization**, including:

- Research Tracks led by stakeholder teams  
- Reference Implementations to validate concepts  
- Open RFC Process for evolving shared specs  
- Monthly Demo Sessions to showcase progress  

Our model is agile and open, designed to align quickly with real-world use and broader standards movements.


## Initiatives

These represent areas of **active exploration**, not guaranteed deliverables:

- **Transformations**  
  Adapters for translating avatars and metadata between UBF, MML, glTF, VRM, and other formats.

- **Rigging & Meshes**  
  Documentation and conversion tools for rig standardization across ecosystems.

- **Agentic Avatars**  
  Standards, tools and MCPs that enable avatars to communicate with LLMs and agent systems.

- **Interpreters**  
  Cross-engine runtimes for executing avatar logic and behaviors in Unity, Unreal, Three.js, etc.

- **Rendering**  
  A shared testing space for visualizing avatar appearance and behavior across engines and agents.

- **Token-Enabled Identity** 
  Interoperable systems for DID-based ownership, wallet-linked avatars, and access control.

- **Public Registries**  
  Open registries for avatar models, licensing, rigging, animations, etc.
